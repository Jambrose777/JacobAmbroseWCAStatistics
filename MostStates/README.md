# Description
This statistic shows the number of US States that someone has competed in.
- States = Total number of states competed in.
- Person = Competitor w/ link to profile
- Total Comps = The total number of competitions the person has competed in
- List = List of all the states with the number of times competed in that state in ().

*Note:* This leave out Multiple Citites (Regional FMC compeititons) as a state since it is impossible to determine which state the person competed. This also leads to the sum of the values in List to be less than or equal to Total Comps
